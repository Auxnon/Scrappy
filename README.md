# Scrappy
Web crawler with the intent of capturing small digestible snapshots of the web
Intended as a visualizer to capture the internet as a whole within some tangible capacity

- 8x8 to 16x16 images to both keep size way down, easy to store in SQL, and built in censorship for the more questionable sites
- multi threaded puppeteer backend
- visually interesting 3d representations
